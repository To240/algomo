A basic search feature for Marvel characters.

Uses an express server to retrieve all of the Marvel characters, and then allows the user to search through them on the front end.

Doesn't actually do anything once a search is made as it is out of scope of the task.

To get it working:

npm i

npm start

nodemon server
